# Use Case 4: Legacy Modernization - Transforming Your Past

Legacy systems often hold critical yet outdated business logic and infrastructure. This slide outlines how Kore addresses these challenges through a modernized approach:

- **Deep-Dive Analysis:**  
  Thorough examination of legacy code to uncover hidden dependencies and outdated practices.
  
- **Automated Documentation:**  
  Generation of comprehensive system documentation to capture intricate details of existing logic.
  
- **Intelligent Business Logic Extraction:**  
  Identification and extraction of core business rules from legacy systems for reuse and modernization.
  
- **Strategic Conversion:**  
  Methodical approach to converting legacy code into streamlined, modern frameworks and architectures.

Speaker Notes:
In this slide, we focus on the transformation of legacy systems. The content emphasizes:
1. A deep-dive analysis of outdated software to identify potential areas for modernization.
2. Automated documentation to reduce manual labor and improve the accuracy of system information.
3. Intelligent extraction of business logic to preserve essential functionalities during the modernization process.
4. A strategic conversion roadmap that transitions legacy code to sustainable, modern solutions.

The visual below contrasts outdated code snippets with modern, clean code examples to demonstrate the transformative power of Kore's approach. This contrast helps illustrate the benefits and challenges involved in modernizing legacy systems.
