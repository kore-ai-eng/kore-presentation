Speaker Notes:
This slide highlights how Kore converts raw data into actionable intelligence. The image models extract detailed insights from visual data, paving the way for auto-generated guidelines that standardize our recommendations. By incorporating multilingual document identification, the system efficiently processes international content.

Our asynchronous web crawling mechanism ensures data remains current by continuously gathering online information. The model context protocol further refines this process, delivering precise and contextually relevant outputs. Together, these capabilities build a robust framework for data enrichment, driving improved decision-making and operational excellence.
